This directory contains information about the papers I downloaded from the web and thought worth hanging onto (some of the papers relate to an [earlier book](http://knosof.co.uk/cbook/)).

I have a scatter gun approach to downloading papers, which are then ruthlessly culled; see http://shape-of-code.com/2016/06/10/finding-the-gold-nugget-papers-in-software-engineering-research/

The title of each directory is the topic area I thought most applicable for the paper.

Each directory contains a `contents.txt` file.  The format of this file is:

    file-name (status) d

    Paper's title

The `(status) d` sequences after the file-name are optional, and denote status information about the data associated with the paper.

If `(status)` is missing, the data is available in a file.

`status` values include:

paper - data contained in paper

cited - cited in book

lost data - authors have lost the data

confidential - data is confidential

emailed - authors not replied to my email (not always upto date)

not used - for some reason (usually because not much data)
